/**
 * PDP shipping-eligibility callout (#39).
 *
 * Soft, non-absolute copy by design — Codex flagged that the previous
 * "every SKU ships nationwide" wording was too strong. Some catalog
 * items are Plant Pickup Only or carry FedEx surcharges, and Atlanta
 * delivery depends on ZIP starting with 30 (gated by checkout). What
 * the customer actually sees is the option matrix at checkout, so this
 * card sets that expectation rather than promising shipping on every
 * SKU.
 *
 * Future-state: per-SKU shipping overrides in Strapi (e.g. "this item
 * is Atlanta pickup only" or "ships only Mon-Wed for transit-time"
 * gates). When those land, this component should accept them as props
 * and branch.
