## Unmapped Menu Items (23)

These navigation items have NO matching product tags and need manual mapping or new tags created:

### Prepared Foods (4 unmapped)
- **Ready to Eat** → Entree Dishes *(suggest: create L3: Beef Entrees, Chicken Entrees tags)*
- **Ready to Eat** → Side Dishes *(suggest: use L2: Sides tag)*
- **Ready to Cook** → Marinated Meats *(suggest: create L3: Marinated Meats tag)*
- **Ready to Cook** → Stuffed Items *(suggest: create L3: Stuffed Items tag)*
- **Smoked & Cured** → Smoked Trout *(suggest: create L3: Smoked Trout tag)*

### Beef (4 unmapped - These are ATTRIBUTES, not products)
- **By Type** → Butcher's Choice *(this is a quality/sourcing attribute)*
- **By Type** → Grass Fed & Natural *(this is a sourcing attribute)*
- **By Type** → Certified Organic *(this is a certification attribute)*
- **By Type** → Budget Friendly *(this is a price tier attribute)*
- **Specialty** → Stew Meat *(exists as L3: Stew & Braising Meat)*
- **Specialty** → Soup Bones *(exists as L3: Soup & Marrow Bones)*

**Recommendation**: Use Medusa collections for these attribute-based groupings instead of tags

### Poultry (4 unmapped - Supplier names)
- **By Source** → David Elliot *(supplier/brand name)*
- **By Source** → AgriStar *(supplier/brand name)*
- **By Source** → Organic *(certification attribute)*
- **By Source** → Antibiotic-Free *(certification attribute)*

**Recommendation**: These should be product metadata filters or separate collections, not tags

### Sausages, Burgers, Hotdogs (2 unmapped)
- **Sausages** → Gourmet Sausages *(suggest: create L3: Gourmet Sausages tag)*
- **Burgers** → Gourmet Burgers *(suggest: create L3: Gourmet Burgers tag)*

### Deli (4 unmapped)
- **Sliced Meats** → Sliced Deli *(exists as L2: Sliced Meats - map to parent)*
- **Sliced Meats** → Deli Chubs *(exists as L3: Salami Chubs)*
- **Specialty Items** → Drywors *(suggest: create L3: Drywors tag)*
- **Specialty Items** → Smoked Meats *(exists as L3: Smoked Fish, Smoked Salmon - create generic L3: Smoked Meats)*

### Provisions (2 unmapped)
- **Essentials** → Cooking Supplies *(exists as L3: Cooking Oils, Baking Essentials - map to L2: Pantry or Baking Supplies)*
- **Essentials** → Kosher Accessories *(suggest: create new L3: Kosher Accessories tag)*

## Orphaned Tags Not in Navigation (176 tags)

### All L1 Tags Are Orphaned (4)
These are department-level tags not represented in navigation:
- Butcher Counter
- Deli Counter  
- Kitchen Counter
- Provisions

**Recommendation**: These could be top-level browsing categories or filters

### Notable L2 Tags Not in Navigation (21)
- Fish *(should this be in navigation?)*
- Sides *(should map to "Side Dishes")*
- Charcuterie
- Franks & Dogs *(similar to your "Hotdogs" menu)*
- Sliced Meats *(similar to "Sliced Deli")*
- Hand Pies & Rolls
- Beef Entrees, Chicken Entrees, Turkey Entrees, Veal Entrees
- Sweets & Baked Goods
- Cured Meats
- Prepared Specialties
- And more...

### L3 Tags Not in Navigation (148)
Too many to list, but includes specific items like:
- Many steak varieties (Ribeye, Strip, Flat Iron, Hanger, etc.)
- Specific chicken cuts (Drumsticks, Leg Quarters, Cut-Up Chicken)
- Prepared items (Meatballs, Meatloaf, Kishke, Blintzes)
- Specialty items (Gefilte Fish, Chopped Liver, Tzimmes)
- Provisions (Challah, Babka, Pickles, Olives, etc.)

---

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Tag Products (REQUIRED FIRST)
Before tag-based collections can work:
1. **Option A**: Manually tag products in Strapi admin
   - Time consuming but accurate
   - Assign L2/L3 tags to each product

2. **Option B**: Auto-tag based on product titles
   - Parse product titles for keywords
   - Match to existing tags
   - Requires review/refinement

3. **Option C**: Use hybrid approach
   - Tag core products manually (top sellers, featured items)
   - Auto-tag remaining products
   - Iterate and refine

### Phase 2: Navigation Strategy

**For Mapped Items (50)**:
- Use existing tag slugs for URLs
- Products already have logical tag matches

**For Attribute-Based Items** (Butcher's Choice, Grass Fed, Organic, etc.):
- Keep as Medusa collections (curated lists)
- Don't try to force into tag system

**For Supplier Names** (David Elliot, AgriStar):
- Use product metadata filters
- Or create brand collections in Medusa

**For Missing Tags** (10-12 items):
- Create new L3 tags: Gourmet Sausages, Marinated Meats, Stuffed Items, Drywors, etc.
- Add to Strapi ProductTag content type

### Phase 3: Expand Navigation

Consider adding more menu items for high-value orphaned tags:
- Fish (major category missing from navigation)
- More specific beef steaks (Ribeye, Strip, Flat Iron)
- Prepared entrees (distinct from raw meats)
- Provisions/Pantry items (Challah, Pickles, etc.)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decide Tagging Strategy**: How do you want to tag the products?
2. **Create Missing Tags**: Add 10-12 new tags for unmapped menu items
3. **Implement Tag-Based Collections**: Once products are tagged
4. **Update Navigation URLs**: Map all 73 items to proper collection pages

---

## Technical Notes

- Tag slugs generated from tag values (after removing L1:/L2:/L3: prefix)
- URL structure will be: `/{countryCode}/collections/{tag-slug}`
- Can reuse existing collection page template with tag filtering
- Algolia filters: Need to index `Categorization.ProductTags` field
