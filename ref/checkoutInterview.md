1. “Undetermined” handling: If an item’s availability is truly unknown, should customers be able to order it at all? Or should it be hidden until a date is set?

Good point. You are right, such items should be disabled in QB so that they are not visible on the website, so ignore this “Undetermined” option

2. Availability date granularity: Does he need time-of-day precision, or is date-level sufficient? (I assume date-level is fine.)

No, just a date

3. Who updates these fields? Is this something he’ll do in the Chrome plugin interface, or does it sync from QuickBooks somehow

I or my admin staff will do this as it is based on a combination of communication from our vendors and/or our internal production

4. Passover cutoff: Is there a date after which Passover orders can no longer be placed? Or is it purely gated by delivery logistics?

We do publish “Order Deadline” dates so as to get the customer orders in in a timely fashion BUT in reality, it is gated by delivery/shipping logistics

Here are the answers to the 3 questions. I am also going to record a voice message as you asked

Open Questions for Your Dad

1.                   Passover/Holiday Inventory: Can customers order Passover items outside the plant conversion window and receive them early (to freeze)? Or does inventory availability inherently gate this?

This is one of the things that is critically important to build into the new website:

To answer this, it is necessary to understand the procedure in the +/- 3 months before Passover begins, typically early March and beginning of April.

Depending on the particular year (Jewish holidays dates are based on the lunar calendar, not the Gregorian calendar) and therefore the actual dates change from year to year. We have to kosher the plant typically between mid-December and mid January, only after which we can begin producing certain products that are kosher for Passover. Many (not all) items, both items that we buy in and re-sell and products manufactured by us, have to be specifically certified for Passover.

The issue here is that we want to receive Passover orders as early as possible for purchase planning and production purposes Versus the fact that these items only become available from us much closer to when we actually deliver, ship or have them available for pickup from our plant.

So what we need to is to actually enable ALL these Passover-specific items in Quickbooks so that they get published to the website BUT have a qualifier that each of these items will only be physically available from a particular date, depending on the item. In the past, and indeed for the upcoming Passover, I actually edit the item description of each of these items with the phrase “Available from 3/15/26” or “Available Now” which, as you can imagine, is an extremely time-consuming and error-prone exercise.

What I need are the following additional fields that I can edit a table that include the following fields:

            Item Number

            Item Description

            Passover Specific? Y/N

            Availability Date (dropdown list): “Now” or a date which I can insert or “Undertermined”

2.                   Inventory vs. Fulfillment Date Constraints: Are there products where “in stock” doesn’t mean “can ship immediately”? (e.g., turkeys that won’t arrive until closer to Thanksgiving regardless of current inventory)

The exact same logic applies here except that instead of Passover Specific? Y/N, there should be a separate field that is Thanksgiving Specific? Y/N

3.                   Southeast Pickup Minimums: Confirm whether minimums exist and what they are.

There are no minimums as to what a customer may order but currently,

· There are currently various fixed delivery charges per customer order for Southeast deliveries (currently \$22.50)

· There is currently a minimum UPS shipping charge, currently \$40 for UPS shipping. However, with the new UPS shipping module, this will change significantly!

· There is currently an inversely proportional local delivery charge based on the value of the order
