## Key Findings

✅ **172 out of 215 tags (80%) have products assigned**  
❌ **43 tags (20%) have zero products**  
⚠️ **Most tags have only 1 product** - likely test/sample data

**Note**: The fact that almost all tags have exactly 1 product suggests this is sample/test data in Strapi, not production data.

## Next Steps

Since products ARE tagged (172 tags have products), the tag-based collection system should work!

**Test these collection URLs now:**

1. http://localhost:8000/us/collections/brisket (should show 1 brisket product)
2. http://localhost:8000/us/collections/ground-beef (should show 1 ground beef product)
3. http://localhost:8000/us/collections/whole-chickens (should show 1 chicken product)
4. http://localhost:8000/us/collections/beef-sausages (should show 1 sausage product)

If these work, all 50 mapped navigation links will function correctly!
